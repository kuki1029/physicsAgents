## üöÄ Getting Started

### Setup Instructions

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/kuki1029/physicsAgents
cd physicsAgents

# 2. Build the docker image
docker compose build

# 3. Run docker containers
docker compose up
```

This will spin up all the required containers for the site to work.

> The dev server will usually start at `http://localhost:5173`.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the `backend/` directory with the following variables:

```env
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key_here
```

I used Groq as it was mostly free.
